# models

Automatically generated stuff from AWS Amplify, used to create the recording elements, so the app can actually understand what's happening, which is a good thing imo.


## ModelProvider.dart

Providing the model? Idk what this does...


## Recording.dart

Creates the Recording class, so the rest of the app can read it, which makes my life easier.
