# pages

Main folder for front end in the app, with exceptions (of course). This is where I feel like I've spend most of my life, wether that's a good thing, depends on who you ask.


## awsLoginPages

This is where I hide the worst code, some would say (that someone is me). But also where all the front end for the login pages are located, copied from my Firebase login pages, they were just as awful.


## mainAppPages

Main place for all the pages, that you see when you are logged in to the app.


## homePage.dart

I don't think this is used any more, therefore it needs to begone.


## mainAppPage.dart

The glue that holds everything together, this is where the main page of the app is when logged in.
